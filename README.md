# Project

Basic Idea:
An app with CRUD functionality for household gardening. So you can add a plant you've planted, delete one that has died, read what's in your garden, and update the record of the plant with when it next needs watering (in days). 

The app has 2 databases, one for edible plants, the other for flowers. The fields could be their names, date planted, days till next water. If they need to be different, an extra collumn could be added: when to pick and when they bloom.
